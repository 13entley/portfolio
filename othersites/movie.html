			<h4>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</h4>

			<p class="movie">
				Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!

			<h4>I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.</h4>

			<p class="movie">
				<strong>Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't.</strong>
				<br>
				I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move, could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. 
				<br>
				Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.
